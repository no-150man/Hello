Q6) 3 methods of git reset?

Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD ), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory. There are three command line options that correspond to the three trees. The options --soft, --mixed , and --hard can be passed to git reset.
